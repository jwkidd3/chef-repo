The chef-repo
===============
All installations require a central workspace known as the chef-repo. This is a place where primitive objects--cookbooks, roles, environments, data bags, and chef-repo configuration files--are stored and managed.

The chef-repo should be kept under version control, such as [git](http://git-scm.org), and then managed as if it were source code.
